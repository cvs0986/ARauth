## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up GitHub Project Board (Optional)

To create a Kanban board, you need to refresh your GitHub CLI token with project scopes:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s project,read:project
```

Then create the project:
```bash
gh project create --title "IAM Development Board" --owner cvs0986
```

Or create it via GitHub web interface:
1. Go to: https://github.com/cvs0986/ARauth
2. Click "Projects" tab
3. Click "New project"
4. Choose "Board" template
5. Add columns: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done
6. Link issues to the project

### 2. Create Feature Branches

I can help you create feature branches for each major component:

```bash
# Example branches to create:
git checkout -b feature/project-setup
git checkout -b feature/core-infrastructure
git checkout -b feature/user-management
git checkout -b feature/authentication
# etc.
```

### 3. Start Development

Begin with Issue #1 (Project Setup) and work through the issues in order.
